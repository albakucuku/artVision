# artVision: AI-Powered Artwork Classifier

## Overview

ArtVision is an AI-powered artwork classification and recognition system that leverages deep learning techniques to identify and categorize artworks based on their style, period, or artist. This project aims to provide a robust tool for art enthusiasts, historians, and curators to analyze and recognize artworks efficiently.

## Features

- **Artwork Classification**: Classifies artworks into different styles, periods, or artists.
- **High Accuracy**: Utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to achieve high accuracy in artwork recognition.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A web or mobile application where users can upload images of artworks and receive predictions.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Detailed process for training and evaluating the model on a diverse dataset of artworks.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/artvision.git
    cd artvision
    ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Dataset

The project requires a dataset of artwork images labeled with their corresponding style, period, or artist. You can use publicly available datasets from sources like Kaggle, museum collections, or academic repositories.

- **Dataset Preparation**: Ensure all images are standardized to the same size and format. Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocess the dataset by resizing images, normalizing pixel values, and splitting into train/validation/test sets.

2. **Model Training**: Train the model using the preprocessed dataset.
    ```python
    python src/train.py
    ```

3. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance on the test set.
    ```python
    python src/evaluate.py
    ```

4. **Running the Application**: Deploy the application and start the server.
    ```python
    python src/app.py
    ```

5. **Using the Application**: Open the web or mobile application, upload an artwork image, and get the classification result.
